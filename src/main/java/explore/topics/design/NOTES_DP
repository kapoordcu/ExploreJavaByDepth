In software design, tight coupling is often considered to be a liability in design. When one class knows explicitly about the design and implementation of another class,
its raise the risk that changes to one class will break the other class.


Dependency Injection Pattern is nothing but the best way to enable loose coupling

A class has dependency on some other class and knows a lot about the other classes it interacts with is said to be tightly coupled. When a class knows explicitly
about the design and implementation of another class, its raise the risk that changes to one class will break the other class.
